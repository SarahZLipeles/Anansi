# Anansi

Teach software engineers the importance of algorithm efficiency in a 1-on-1 strategic game environment setting
## Technical Requirements
 - Javascript
 - Data Structures / Algorithm
 - Mechanics of webcrawlers
 - Hash / Cryptography
## Winning Objective
- First player that captures the opponent's home base wins
## Game Rules
-   **Player Interaction**
    -   Implement a Javascript algorithm strategy that eithers:
        1. Locates and capture the opponent's base
        2. Protect homebase or acquired nodes
-   **Actions Permitted**
    - Assign observer unit's movement and direction (at each encountered node)
    - Assign miner unit's destination to **attack**(unclaimed) or **defend**(claimed) nodes
-   **Action Constraints**
    -   Actions are constrained by the amount of resources available at that point in time
-   **Resources Generation**
    -   A fixed amount of resources are generated by homebase per interval
